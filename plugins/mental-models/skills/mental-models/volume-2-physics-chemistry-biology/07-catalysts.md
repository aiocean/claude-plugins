# Catalysts

> "A catalyst enables reactions that otherwise wouldn't happen."

## Core Concept

A **Catalyst** is a substance that accelerates a chemical reaction without being consumed by it. It lowers the activation energy, making things happen faster or making impossible reactions possible.

As a mental model, catalysts are people, tools, events, or conditions that accelerate change while remaining unchanged themselves.

## The Fundamental Truth

Some changes need a catalyst to happen. Without one:
- The activation energy is too high
- The process is too slow
- The reaction never starts

With the right catalyst:
- Barriers are lowered
- Speed increases dramatically
- What seemed impossible becomes possible

## Types of Catalysts

### People as Catalysts

**Connectors:** People who introduce others, creating relationships that wouldn't form naturally
- They don't benefit directly but enable the connection

**Coaches/Mentors:** People who accelerate growth in others
- They share knowledge but don't lose it

**Facilitators:** People who make group processes more effective
- They enable decisions without making them

### Events as Catalysts

**Crises:** Force rapid change
- Economic downturns drive efficiency
- Pandemics accelerate digital transformation
- Personal setbacks spark reinvention

**Deadlines:** Create urgency
- "The project was impossible until it became due tomorrow"
- Parkinson's Law: Work expands to fill available time

**Serendipitous meetings:** Spark new directions
- A conversation at a conference
- An unexpected introduction
- A chance encounter

### Tools as Catalysts

**Technology:** Enables previously impossible actions
- Internet catalyzed global commerce
- AI catalyzing knowledge work transformation
- Smartphones catalyzed mobile behavior change

**Frameworks:** Accelerate thinking and doing
- Agile catalyzes software development
- Design thinking catalyzes innovation
- Mental models catalyze better decisions

### Conditions as Catalysts

**Environment:** Shapes what happens
- Being in a startup hub catalyzes entrepreneurship
- Being around smart people catalyzes growth
- The right culture catalyzes innovation

**Incentives:** Drive behavior
- Compensation structures catalyze sales behavior
- Recognition catalyzes engagement
- Competition catalyzes performance

## Catalyst Properties

### 1. They're Not Consumed
True catalysts remain unchanged:
- A mentor doesn't lose wisdom by sharing
- A framework doesn't diminish with use
- A network connector doesn't lose connections

### 2. They Lower Activation Energy
Catalysts make starting easier:
- A template lowers the barrier to begin
- An introduction removes the cold approach
- A crisis removes the "someday" option

### 3. They Can Be Reused
The same catalyst works repeatedly:
- One mentor can catalyze many proteges
- One framework can catalyze many projects
- One crisis can catalyze many changes

### 4. They're Specific
The right catalyst for one reaction may not work for another:
- A coding mentor doesn't catalyze marketing skills
- A deadline catalyzes some people, paralyzes others
- Crisis catalyzes some organizations, destroys others

## Finding Your Catalysts

### Personal Growth Catalysts
- Who accelerates your learning?
- What environments bring out your best?
- Which experiences have sparked major changes?
- What tools multiply your capability?

### Business Catalysts
- What conditions lead to breakthroughs?
- Who unlocks new opportunities?
- Which events drive transformation?
- What tools accelerate execution?

### Relationship Catalysts
- Who makes introductions?
- What environments create connection?
- Which shared experiences deepen bonds?

## Being a Catalyst

You can be a catalyst for others:

### Connector
- Introduce people who should know each other
- See non-obvious connections
- Follow up to ensure connection happens

### Enabler
- Share knowledge freely
- Remove obstacles for others
- Create opportunities without claiming credit

### Accelerator
- Ask the question that unlocks insight
- Provide the perspective that changes framing
- Offer the resource that enables action

## Catalyzing Change

### When Change Isn't Happening

Ask: "What catalyst is missing?"

Options:
- **Add urgency:** Create a deadline or crisis
- **Add enablement:** Provide tools or resources
- **Add connection:** Introduce the right people
- **Add environment:** Change the context

### When Change Is Slow

Ask: "What would accelerate this?"

Options:
- **Better catalyst:** Is the current one optimal?
- **More catalyst:** Sometimes more accelerates
- **Remove inhibitors:** What's blocking the catalyst?

## Catalyst vs. Participant

| Catalyst | Participant |
|----------|-------------|
| Enables reaction | Part of reaction |
| Unchanged after | Changed after |
| Accelerates process | Is the process |
| Can be reused | Is consumed |

A mentor (catalyst) enables growth but isn't changed.
A learner (participant) is transformed by the process.

## Warning: Catalyst Dependency

Some catalysts create dependency:
- Can you perform without the catalyst?
- Is the catalyst a crutch?
- What happens when the catalyst is removed?

**Goal:** Use catalysts to get started, then internalize the capability.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Catalysts accelerate change** - They lower barriers and speed processes
2. **They're not consumed** - The same catalyst works repeatedly
3. **Right catalyst, right reaction** - Specificity matters
4. **You can be a catalyst** - Enable others without being depleted
5. **Watch for dependency** - Use catalysts as accelerators, not crutches

## The Catalyst Question

When something needs to happen but isn't:

**"What would catalyze this?"**

## Related Models

- **Activation Energy** - Catalysts lower it
- **Leverage** - Catalysts are a form of leverage
- **Network Effects** - Connectors catalyze networks
