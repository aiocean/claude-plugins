# Niches

> "Find your niche—the place where your unique abilities meet the world's needs."

## Core Concept

A **Niche** is a specific role or position that an organism fills in its ecosystem—its unique way of surviving by exploiting particular resources or conditions.

As a mental model, niches remind us that success often comes not from broad competition but from finding and dominating a specific, defensible position.

## The Fundamental Truth

You don't have to be the best at everything. You need to be the best at something specific:
- In a space with less competition
- Where your unique strengths apply
- That provides sustainable resources

**The niche advantage:** Being the best option for a specific need, rather than a mediocre option for a general need.

## Properties of Strong Niches

### 1. Specificity
The more specific, the less competition:
- "Marketing consultant" → Crowded
- "Marketing consultant for B2B SaaS companies" → Less crowded
- "Marketing consultant for B2B SaaS in healthcare" → Niche

### 2. Defensibility
Hard for others to enter:
- Requires specialized knowledge
- Requires specific credentials
- Requires established relationships
- Requires unique combinations

### 3. Sustainable Resources
The niche must provide enough:
- Customers/revenue to survive
- Growth potential
- Longevity (not disappearing)

### 4. Fit with Capabilities
Your unique abilities match the niche requirements:
- Natural strengths
- Developed skills
- Accumulated experience
- Genuine interest

## Finding Your Niche

### Step 1: Map Your Strengths

What are you uniquely good at?
- Skills you've developed
- Knowledge you've accumulated
- Experiences you've had
- Perspectives you bring

### Step 2: Map Market Needs

What does the world need that you could provide?
- Problems people will pay to solve
- Gaps in current offerings
- Underserved segments
- Emerging opportunities

### Step 3: Find the Intersection

Where do your strengths meet needs?
- Not just where you're interested
- Not just where there's money
- Where YOUR strengths match specific needs

### Step 4: Test Specificity

Is your niche specific enough?
- Who exactly is the customer?
- What exactly is the problem?
- Why exactly would they choose you?

### Step 5: Validate Sustainability

Can you survive here?
- Enough demand?
- Enough margin?
- Enough longevity?

## Niche Strategy

### The Wedge Strategy

Start narrow, expand from strength:
1. Dominate a tiny niche
2. Use that as a beachhead
3. Expand to adjacent niches
4. Eventually compete more broadly

**Amazon:** Started with books (niche), expanded to everything (market).

### The Blue Ocean Strategy

Create new niches rather than compete in existing ones:
- Combine features in novel ways
- Serve unserved customers
- Solve unsolved problems
- Create new categories

### The Expertise Stack

Combine multiple areas to create a unique niche:
- Skill A + Skill B + Skill C = Unique position
- Developer + Designer + Marketer = Full-stack creator
- Finance + Healthcare + AI = Rare specialist

## Niche Dangers

### 1. Too Narrow

The niche is too small to sustain you:
- Not enough customers
- Not enough revenue
- No room to grow

**Test:** Is there at least a viable market?

### 2. Too Broad

The niche isn't really a niche:
- Too much competition
- No clear differentiation
- Commoditized pricing

**Test:** Are you clearly the best option for someone?

### 3. Dying Niche

The niche is disappearing:
- Technology is changing
- Market is shrinking
- Needs are evolving

**Test:** Is this niche growing or declining?

### 4. Trapped in Niche

You're too dependent on a single niche:
- Can't expand
- Can't adapt
- Vulnerable to change

**Test:** Can you expand from here if needed?

## Evolution of Niches

Niches aren't permanent:
- Markets change
- Competition enters
- Needs evolve
- You grow

**Strategy:** Be ready to evolve your niche over time while maintaining core strengths.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Specific beats general** - Dominate narrow before competing broad
2. **Match strengths to needs** - Niche should fit your capabilities
3. **Defensibility matters** - Can you hold the position?
4. **Size appropriately** - Big enough to sustain, small enough to dominate
5. **Plan for evolution** - Niches change; be ready to adapt

- **"Where can I be the best option, not just a good option?"**
- **"What specific problem can I solve better than anyone?"**
