# Activation Energy

> "The hardest part of any task is getting started."

## Core Concept

**Activation Energy** is the minimum energy required to start a chemical reaction. In life, it represents the disproportionately high effort needed to begin something compared to continuing it once started.

Getting going is almost always harder than keeping going.

## The Fundamental Truth

Starting requires overcoming initial resistance. This resistance is highest at the very beginning, then diminishes once momentum builds.

- **High activation energy:** Hard to start
- **Low activation energy:** Easy to start

The goal: Lower the activation energy for good behaviors; raise it for bad ones.

## The Chemistry Analogy

In chemistry:
- Reactants need energy to transform into products
- Once the reaction starts, it often becomes self-sustaining
- Catalysts lower the activation energy required

In life:
- New habits need willpower to begin
- Once established, habits become automatic
- Triggers and environment design act as catalysts

## Why Starting Is So Hard

### 1. Transition Cost
Moving from one state to another requires effort:
- Stopping what you're doing
- Mentally switching contexts
- Overcoming the comfort of current state

### 2. Uncertainty
Before starting, everything is unknown:
- Will this work?
- What will happen?
- Can I do this?

### 3. Decision Fatigue
Starting often requires decisions:
- What to do first?
- How to approach it?
- What tools to use?

### 4. Fear of Commitment
Starting implies continuing:
- Am I ready for this?
- What am I signing up for?

## The 20-Second Rule

Shawn Achor discovered that reducing activation energy by just 20 seconds dramatically increased habit formation.

**His experiment:**
- Wanted to learn guitar
- Guitar was in the closet (30 seconds to access)
- Result: Only played 4 times in 3 weeks

**The fix:**
- Put guitar in the middle of the room (10 seconds to access)
- Result: Played every single day

**The principle:** Remove 20 seconds of friction to start good habits; add 20 seconds of friction to stop bad ones.

## Strategies to Lower Activation Energy

### 1. Reduce Steps

**Before:** Want to exercise → Change clothes → Find gear → Go to gym → Warm up → Exercise

**After:** Want to exercise → Step into gym clothes laid out by bed → 1 pushup

### 2. Remove Intermediate Steps

Every step between intention and action is a barrier:
- Pre-prepare everything
- Eliminate decisions
- Create clear, immediate next actions

### 3. Make It Tiny

The smaller the starting action, the lower the activation energy:
- Don't "write a book" — Write one sentence
- Don't "get fit" — Do one pushup
- Don't "clean the house" — Pick up one item

### 4. Use Triggers

Attach new behaviors to existing habits:
- After coffee → journal
- After brushing teeth → meditate
- After sitting at desk → write

### 5. Environment Design

Make good choices the default:
- Healthy food visible, junk food hidden
- Book on pillow, phone in another room
- Gym clothes by the bed

## Strategies to Raise Activation Energy (For Bad Habits)

### 1. Add Steps

Make bad behaviors harder to start:
- Log out of time-wasting sites
- Delete apps from phone
- Put junk food in hard-to-reach places

### 2. Create Delays

Force waiting periods:
- 10-second pause before eating
- Mandatory delay before purchases
- "Sleep on it" rule for decisions

### 3. Add Friction

Make bad choices inconvenient:
- Leave wallet at home (for impulse buying)
- Unsubscribe from tempting emails
- Block websites during work hours

## Applications

### Productivity

**Problem:** Hard to start deep work
**Solution:**
- Start with ritual (same coffee, same seat)
- Begin with tiniest action (open document)
- Remove distractions before needing willpower (phone away)

### Exercise

**Problem:** Never feel like going to gym
**Solution:**
- Sleep in workout clothes
- Gym bag packed by door
- Just drive to gym (don't commit to workout yet)

### Creative Work

**Problem:** Blank page is terrifying
**Solution:**
- Start with stream of consciousness
- Work on worst draft first
- Begin with easiest part

### Learning

**Problem:** Books sit unread
**Solution:**
- Leave book in reading spot
- Start with one page
- Read during existing idle time

### Relationships

**Problem:** Hard to maintain connections
**Solution:**
- Schedule recurring contacts
- Keep messages drafted
- Use automation for reminders

## The Activation Energy Audit

For any behavior you want to change:

**To increase:** How many steps from intention to action? → Reduce them

**To decrease:** How easy is it right now? → Add obstacles

| Behavior | Current Activation Energy | Goal | Change |
|----------|--------------------------|------|--------|
| Exercise | High (gym far, clothes not ready) | Low | Prep the night before |
| Social media | Low (app on home screen) | High | Delete app, use browser only |
| Reading | Medium (books in another room) | Low | Book on coffee table |
| Junk food | Low (in visible cabinet) | High | Put in high, hidden place |

## The Compound Effect

Once you start, other forces take over:
- **Momentum:** Easier to continue than to stop
- **Progress:** Small wins create motivation
- **Habit:** Neural pathways form through repetition
- **Identity:** You become "someone who does X"

The hard part is just the beginning. After that, inertia works for you instead of against you.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Starting is the hardest part** - Activation energy is highest initially
2. **Lower barriers for good** - Remove every possible obstacle
3. **Raise barriers for bad** - Add friction to unwanted behaviors
4. **Think in 20-second changes** - Small friction differences matter enormously
5. **Make it tiny** - The smaller the start, the easier to begin

## The Magic Question

Before trying to add a new habit, ask:

**"How can I make this so easy that I can't say no?"**

## Related Models

- **Inertia** - Once moving, keep moving
- **Friction** - What prevents starting
- **Compounding** - Small starts lead to big results
