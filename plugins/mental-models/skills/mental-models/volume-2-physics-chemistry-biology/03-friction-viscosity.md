# Friction and Viscosity

> "Reduce friction, and everything becomes easier."

## Core Concept

**Friction** is the resistance that opposes motion between surfaces. **Viscosity** is the internal resistance of a fluid to flow. Both represent forces that slow things down.

As mental models, they remind us that:
- Every process has resistance that slows it down
- Reducing friction makes things flow faster
- Sometimes friction is useful (it prevents things from happening too fast)
- Identifying and removing unnecessary friction is a superpower

## The Fundamental Truth

Nothing moves without encountering resistance. The question is:
- How much friction exists?
- Is it necessary friction or unnecessary friction?
- Can we reduce it?

**High friction = slow, difficult, unlikely to happen**
**Low friction = fast, easy, likely to happen**

## Types of Friction

### Physical Friction
- Door handle that's hard to turn
- Shoes that slip on wet floors
- Traffic congestion

### Process Friction
- Forms with too many fields
- Approval chains that delay decisions
- Meetings that could be emails

### Psychological Friction
- Anxiety about making a call
- Decision fatigue from too many choices
- Uncertainty about the next step

### Social Friction
- Awkwardness in new relationships
- Politics in organizations
- Misaligned incentives

## The Amazon Principle

Amazon is fanatically focused on reducing customer friction:
- **1-Click ordering** - Eliminates checkout friction
- **Prime** - Removes shipping cost consideration
- **Alexa ordering** - Voice is lower friction than typing
- **Subscribe & Save** - Removes repeat purchase friction

**Result:** Easier to buy → More purchases

## Applications

### Product Design

**Every additional step reduces completion:**
- Each form field → X% drop-off
- Each page load → Y% abandonment
- Each decision point → Z% confusion

**What to do:**
- Minimize steps to core action
- Default to sensible options
- Remove unnecessary inputs
- Speed up every interaction

### Habit Formation

**To build habits, reduce friction:**
- Put gym clothes by the bed
- Prepare healthy snacks in advance
- Leave the book on your pillow
- Open the app before you "don't feel like it"

**To break habits, add friction:**
- Delete the app from your phone
- Move junk food to a high shelf
- Add steps between impulse and action
- Make the bad choice inconvenient

### Sales and Conversion

**Friction kills conversions:**
- Long checkout processes
- Unclear pricing
- Required account creation
- Slow page loads

**What to do:**
- Offer guest checkout
- Show pricing upfront
- Reduce fields to minimum
- Optimize for speed

### Organization Efficiency

**Where friction hides:**
- Approval processes
- Information silos
- Unclear ownership
- Meetings that accomplish nothing

**What to do:**
- Question every approval step
- Share information freely
- Define clear owners
- Cancel meetings that don't need to exist

## Viscosity in Systems

Viscosity is friction within a system itself—how easily it flows internally.

**High-viscosity organizations:**
- Decisions take forever
- Information moves slowly
- Change is glacial
- Good ideas die in committees

**Low-viscosity organizations:**
- Fast decision-making
- Information flows freely
- Rapid adaptation
- Bias toward action

## When Friction Is Good

Friction isn't always bad. Sometimes you want resistance:

### Preventing Impulsive Decisions
- Cooling-off periods before major purchases
- Two-factor authentication
- "Are you sure?" prompts
- Sleeping on important decisions

### Creating Quality Control
- Code review before deploy
- Editorial review before publish
- Legal review before signing
- Testing before release

### Building Anticipation
- Lines for exclusive restaurants
- Wait lists for products
- Velvet ropes at clubs

**The key:** Be intentional about where you add or remove friction.

## The Friction Audit

To improve any process:

### Step 1: Map the Process
Document every step from start to finish.

### Step 2: Identify Friction Points
Mark where:
- People drop off
- Delays occur
- Complaints arise
- Workarounds exist

### Step 3: Categorize Friction
For each friction point:
- Necessary or unnecessary?
- Removable or inherent?
- Worth the benefit or not?

### Step 4: Remove Unnecessary Friction
Eliminate everything that doesn't serve a purpose.

### Step 5: Reduce Necessary Friction
For friction that must exist, minimize it.

## Friction in Personal Life

### Social Friction

**High friction (hard to maintain):**
- Friends who require effort
- Relationships that feel draining
- Obligations without reciprocity

**Low friction (easy to maintain):**
- Friends you can pick up with anytime
- Relationships that flow naturally
- Mutual giving and receiving

### Decision Friction

**Reduce daily decision friction:**
- Wear similar clothes (decision uniforms)
- Meal prep on weekends
- Automate bills
- Default to "no" for new commitments

### Health Friction

**To be healthier:**
- Reduce friction: Pre-cut vegetables, gym near work
- Add friction: Hide snacks, delete food delivery apps

## Key Formulas

**Likelihood of Action = Motivation ÷ Friction**

You can increase action by:
1. Increasing motivation (harder)
2. Decreasing friction (often easier)

**Time to Completion = Base Time × Friction Factor**

More friction = exponentially longer time, not just proportionally longer.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Friction determines flow** - High friction stops things; low friction enables them
2. **Audit for friction** - Find where things slow down or drop off
3. **Remove unnecessary friction** - Question every step that creates resistance
4. **Add strategic friction** - Sometimes slowing down is valuable
5. **Small friction adds up** - Many small frictions compound into major barriers

## The Practical Test

For any process or habit:

**To encourage:** "How can I make this easier?"
**To discourage:** "How can I make this harder?"
