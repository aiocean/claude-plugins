# Supply and Demand

> "Price is what you pay. Value is what you get."

## Core Concept

**Supply and Demand** describes how prices emerge from the interaction of buyers and sellers. When demand exceeds supply, prices rise. When supply exceeds demand, prices fall. This simple mechanism allocates resources across the economy.

Understanding supply and demand helps you predict price movements and find opportunities.

## The Basic Mechanics

### Demand
How much buyers want at various prices:
- Higher price → Fewer buyers
- Lower price → More buyers

### Supply
How much sellers offer at various prices:
- Higher price → More sellers willing to produce
- Lower price → Fewer sellers willing to produce

### Equilibrium Price
Where supply equals demand:
- All willing buyers find willing sellers
- No surplus, no shortage
- Market "clears"

## The Price Signal

Prices communicate information:
- **High price says:** "This is scarce, produce more, consume less"
- **Low price says:** "This is abundant, produce less, consume more"

No central planner needed—prices coordinate behavior automatically.

## Shifting Supply and Demand

### Demand Shifts

**Demand increases when:**
- Income rises
- Preferences change toward product
- Price of substitutes rises
- Population grows
- Expectations of future price increase

**Result:** Price rises, quantity rises

### Demand Decreases When:
- Income falls
- Preferences shift away
- Substitutes become cheaper
- Population falls

**Result:** Price falls, quantity falls

### Supply Shifts

**Supply increases when:**
- Production costs fall
- Technology improves
- More producers enter
- Regulations ease

**Result:** Price falls, quantity rises

**Supply decreases when:**
- Costs rise
- Disasters/shortages
- Producers exit
- Regulations tighten

**Result:** Price rises, quantity falls

## Applications

### Career and Salary

Your salary is supply and demand:
- **Demand:** How much do employers want your skills?
- **Supply:** How many people have your skills?

**High salary:** High demand + low supply (rare, valuable skills)
**Low salary:** Low demand or high supply (common skills)

**Strategy:** Develop skills with high demand and low supply.

### Housing Markets

- **Demand drivers:** Population, income, interest rates, desirability
- **Supply constraints:** Land, zoning, construction capacity

**High prices:** Demand grows faster than supply (many cities)
**Low prices:** Supply exceeds demand (declining areas)

### Product Pricing

- **Monopoly/few competitors:** Can set higher prices
- **Many competitors:** Market forces price down
- **Differentiated product:** Can escape commodity pricing

### Labor Markets

- **Skills in demand + scarce:** High wages
- **Skills commoditized + abundant:** Low wages
- **Automation:** Shifts both supply and demand curves

## Beyond Simple Markets

### Inelastic Demand
Some products have demand that doesn't change much with price:
- Life-saving medicines
- Gasoline (short-term)
- Addictive products

**Implication:** Price increases don't reduce demand much. Sellers have power.

### Elastic Demand
Some products have very price-sensitive demand:
- Luxury goods
- Discretionary purchases
- Products with many substitutes

**Implication:** Price increases kill demand. Sellers must be competitive.

### Sticky Prices
Some prices resist movement:
- Wages (downward sticky)
- Menu prices
- Long-term contracts

**Implication:** Adjustment happens through quantity, not price.

## Market Manipulation

### Artificial Scarcity
Limiting supply to raise prices:
- OPEC oil quotas
- Luxury brand limited editions
- De Beers diamond stockpiling

### Artificial Demand
Creating desire to shift demand:
- Marketing and advertising
- Influencer endorsement
- Status association

### Price Controls
Government intervention:
- Price ceilings (rent control) → Shortages
- Price floors (minimum wage) → Surpluses (unemployment)

## Strategic Applications

### Timing Purchases
Buy when supply exceeds demand:
- Off-season purchases
- Buyer's markets
- Clearance periods

### Timing Sales
Sell when demand exceeds supply:
- Peak seasons
- Seller's markets
- Limited availability periods

### Positioning Products
Create conditions for higher prices:
- Differentiation (escape commodity pricing)
- Scarcity (limit supply)
- Status (increase demand)

## Key Takeaways

1. **Price emerges from interaction** - Not set arbitrarily
2. **High price = scarcity signal** - Produce more, consume less
3. **Your salary is supply/demand** - Develop scarce, valued skills
4. **Markets tend toward equilibrium** - Shortages and surpluses correct
5. **Elasticity matters** - Some markets are more price-sensitive

## The Supply/Demand Questions

- **"What's driving demand for this?"**
- **"What's limiting supply?"**
- **"Is this market in equilibrium or moving toward it?"**
- **"How elastic is this demand?"**
- **"What would shift these curves?"**
