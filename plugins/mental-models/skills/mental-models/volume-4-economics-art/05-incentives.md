# Incentives

> "Never, ever, think about something else when you should be thinking about the power of incentives."
> — Charlie Munger

## Core Concept

**Incentives** are the rewards and punishments that motivate behavior. People respond to incentives—often in predictable ways, sometimes in surprising ones. Understanding incentives helps you predict behavior and design systems that work.

If you want to understand why something happens, look at the incentives.

## The Fundamental Truth

People do what they're incentivized to do:
- Reward a behavior → More of it
- Punish a behavior → Less of it
- Neutral → Behavior unchanged

This is so fundamental that it's often overlooked.

## Munger on Incentives

> "I think I've been in the top 5% of my age cohort all my life in understanding the power of incentives, and all my life I've underestimated it. And never a year passes but I get some surprise that pushes my limit a little farther."

Even experts underestimate incentive power.

## Types of Incentives

### Financial Incentives
- Salary, bonuses, commissions
- Prices and costs
- Fines and penalties

### Social Incentives
- Status and reputation
- Belonging and acceptance
- Recognition and praise

### Moral Incentives
- Doing the right thing
- Living up to values
- Sense of purpose

### Natural Incentives
- Pleasure and pain
- Comfort and discomfort
- Survival instincts

## Incentive Alignment

### Well-Aligned Incentives
When someone's incentives match desired outcomes:
- Sales rep paid for customer success (not just closing)
- Doctor paid for patient health (not procedures)
- Politician rewarded for good long-term outcomes

**Result:** Behavior naturally produces good outcomes.

### Misaligned Incentives
When incentives contradict desired outcomes:
- Sales rep paid for closing (even if customer churns)
- Doctor paid per procedure (even if unnecessary)
- Contractor paid for hours (not completion)

**Result:** Perverse behavior that looks strange until you see the incentives.

## The Principal-Agent Problem

When someone (agent) acts on behalf of another (principal):
- Real estate agent wants quick sale (commission) vs. buyer wants best deal
- Financial advisor wants fees vs. client wants returns
- Employee wants easy job vs. employer wants productivity

**The incentives don't match.** Solutions:
- Align compensation with principal's goals
- Transparency and monitoring
- Reputation mechanisms

## Unintended Consequences

Incentives often produce unexpected behavior:

### The Cobra Effect

British India offered bounty for dead cobras. People started breeding cobras. Government ended program. Breeders released cobras. More cobras than before.

**Lesson:** Incentives were gamed.

### Soviet Nail Factory

Factory incentivized by weight of nails produced → Giant, heavy, useless nails.
Incentivized by number of nails → Tiny, useless nails.

**Lesson:** Measure what you actually want.

### Wells Fargo

Employees incentivized on account opening → Created millions of fake accounts.

**Lesson:** Narrow metrics get gamed.

## Designing Incentive Systems

### 1. Align with Desired Outcomes

Reward what you actually want, not proxies for it.
- Don't reward activity if you want outcomes
- Don't reward individual if you want team
- Don't reward short-term if you want long-term

### 2. Consider Gaming

Ask: "If I wanted to maximize this metric without producing real value, how would I do it?"
- Then design to prevent gaming
- Or accept some gaming as cost

### 3. Mix Incentive Types

Financial alone isn't enough:
- Add social recognition
- Connect to purpose
- Create intrinsic motivation

### 4. Watch for Unintended Effects

What behavior does this incentive encourage that you don't want?
- Crowding out intrinsic motivation
- Zero-sum competition
- Short-term optimization

### 5. Keep It Simple

Complex incentive systems:
- Are hard to understand
- Are easier to game
- Create unpredictable behavior

## Analyzing Existing Situations

When behavior seems irrational, look for incentives:
- "Why is this company doing that stupid thing?" → Look at incentives
- "Why is this person behaving badly?" → Look at incentives
- "Why does this persist despite being obviously broken?" → Look at incentives

**The behavior is rational given the incentives.** Change behavior by changing incentives.

## Self-Incentives

You can design incentives for yourself:
- Commitment devices (pre-commit to costs of failure)
- Environment design (make good easy, bad hard)
- Social accountability (tell people your goals)
- Reward structures (treat yourself for progress)

## Key Principles

### Never Ignore Incentives
If incentives point one way and expectations point another, incentives win.

### People Are Not Good or Bad
They respond to incentives. Change the incentives, change the behavior.

### Show Me the Incentive
"Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome." — Munger

### You Get What You Pay For
In a very literal sense—you get the behavior you incentivize.

## Key Takeaways

1. **People respond to incentives** - Predictably, powerfully
2. **Look for incentives to explain behavior** - The answer is usually there
3. **Misaligned incentives cause problems** - Most perverse behavior traces here
4. **Design systems with incentives in mind** - Or accept dysfunction
5. **Mix incentive types** - Financial isn't everything

## The Incentive Questions

- **"What are the incentives here?"**
- **"What behavior do these incentives encourage?"**
- **"Whose incentives are misaligned?"**
- **"How can incentives be realigned?"**
- **"What unintended consequences might these incentives create?"**
