# Frame

> "It's not what you look at that matters, it's what you see."
> — Henry David Thoreau

## Core Concept

**Frame** (or Framing) is about how the same information, presented differently, leads to different conclusions. The frame is the context, perspective, or lens through which something is viewed.

The same fact, framed differently, becomes a different fact.

## The Fundamental Truth

Perception is not objective. How something is framed determines:
- What we notice
- How we interpret it
- How we feel about it
- What decisions we make

**Control the frame, control the interpretation.**

## Classic Examples

### The Glass

- Half empty (loss frame) → Scarcity mindset
- Half full (gain frame) → Abundance mindset
- Completely full (air + water) → Reframe entirely

Same glass, different meaning.

### The Surgery

"90% survival rate" vs. "10% mortality rate"
- Identical information
- Radically different emotional responses
- Different decisions result

### The Price

- "$100" vs. "$99.99"
- "50% off" vs. "Same price as competitor"
- "Investment" vs. "Cost"

Same exchange, different perception.

## Types of Frames

### 1. Gain vs. Loss Frame

**Gain frame:** What you get
- "You'll save $500 per year"
- "Increase productivity by 30%"
- "Add 5 years to your life"

**Loss frame:** What you lose
- "You're wasting $500 per year"
- "Losing 30% of potential productivity"
- "Taking 5 years off your life"

**Insight:** Loss frames are often more powerful (loss aversion), but context matters.

### 2. Absolute vs. Relative Frame

**Absolute:** Raw numbers
- "100 people died"
- "$1 million cost"

**Relative:** Compared to something
- "100 of 1,000,000" (0.01%)
- "1% of annual budget"

**Insight:** Relative frames add context that changes meaning.

### 3. Time Frame

**Short-term:** Immediate effects
- "Hurts today"
- "Costs now"

**Long-term:** Future effects
- "Pays off over years"
- "Investment in future"

**Insight:** Same action looks different across time frames.

### 4. Part vs. Whole Frame

**Part:** Focus on component
- "This ingredient is harmful"
- "That feature is broken"

**Whole:** Focus on system
- "The overall product is safe"
- "The system works well"

**Insight:** Zooming in or out changes what we see.

## How Framing Works

### Anchoring

First information anchors interpretation:
- "Usually $500, now $300" (feels like deal)
- "Just $300" (no anchor, neutral)

### Priming

Prior context shapes current perception:
- Discuss safety → Notice dangers
- Discuss opportunity → Notice potential

### Contrast

Adjacent information changes meaning:
- Large next to small → Seems larger
- Good next to bad → Seems better

### Defaults

What's presented as default becomes baseline:
- Opt-out (default yes) vs. Opt-in (default no)
- Same choice, very different outcomes

## Applications

### In Negotiation

**Frame the starting point:**
- Your anchor sets the range
- Frame your position as reasonable
- Reframe their demands as extreme

**Frame the relationship:**
- Partners solving a problem together
- vs. Adversaries fighting for limited pie

### In Sales/Marketing

**Frame the problem:**
- Make pain vivid before offering solution
- Frame current state as unacceptable

**Frame the price:**
- Compared to what? (competitors, cost of problem)
- Daily cost vs. annual cost
- Investment vs. expense

**Frame the decision:**
- Low-risk choice to try
- vs. Major commitment

### In Leadership

**Frame challenges:**
- Problems → Opportunities
- Setbacks → Learning experiences
- Changes → Evolution

**Frame the mission:**
- Compliance → Purpose
- Work → Craft
- Job → Calling

### In Personal Thinking

**Reframe difficulties:**
- "This is happening TO me" → "This is happening FOR me"
- "I have to" → "I get to"
- "I failed" → "I learned"

## Strategic Reframing

### When to Reframe

- Current frame is limiting
- You're stuck
- Conversation is going nowhere
- Need new perspective

### How to Reframe

1. **Identify current frame** - What lens is being used?
2. **Question the frame** - Is this the only way to see it?
3. **Generate alternatives** - What other frames exist?
4. **Choose strategically** - Which frame serves the goal?
5. **Introduce new frame** - Present alternative view

### Reframing Techniques

**Zoom out:** "Let's look at the bigger picture..."
**Zoom in:** "Let's look at the specific case of..."
**Flip it:** "What if we looked at it from the opposite angle..."
**Time shift:** "How will this look in 10 years..."
**Role shift:** "How would [person] see this..."

## Detecting Frames

Ask yourself:
- What's being emphasized? What's hidden?
- What comparison is being made?
- What emotions is this designed to trigger?
- Who benefits from this frame?
- What's the alternative frame?

**Everyone is framing, always.** The question is whether you see it.

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Not Seeing the Frame

Accepting presented frames as objective truth rather than chosen perspective.

### 2. Wrong Frame for Context

Using gain frame when loss frame would be more effective (or vice versa).

### 3. Fighting Within Their Frame

Arguing within someone else's frame rather than reframing.

### 4. Overcomplicating

Using multiple frames that confuse rather than clarify.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Frame shapes perception** - Same reality, different meaning
2. **All communication is framed** - There's no neutral presentation
3. **You can choose frames** - Don't accept default frames
4. **Reframing is power** - Change the frame, change the game
5. **See frames everywhere** - Build frame awareness

## The Frame Questions

- **"How is this being framed?"**
- **"What alternative frames exist?"**
- **"Who benefits from this frame?"**
- **"What would a reframe reveal?"**
- **"Am I accepting a frame I shouldn't?"**

## Related Models

- **Narrative** - Frame within story structure
- **Contrast** - Frame by juxtaposition
- **Perspective Taking** - Seeing through other frames
