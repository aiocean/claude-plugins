# Opportunity Cost

> "The cost of a thing is the amount of life which is required to be exchanged for it."
> — Henry David Thoreau

## Core Concept

**Opportunity Cost** is the value of the best alternative you give up when making a choice. It's not just what you pay—it's what you could have had instead.

This is the most important concept in economics for decision-making.

## The Fundamental Truth

Every choice has a hidden cost: the next-best option you didn't choose.

**True cost = Explicit cost + Opportunity cost**

Most people only see explicit costs. Wise decision-makers see both.

## Why This Matters

### You Always Pay Twice

When you spend $100 on a meal:
- You pay $100 (explicit)
- You lose what that $100 could have bought (opportunity cost)

### Time Is the Clearest Example

When you spend 2 hours on social media:
- You don't "pay" anything explicit
- You lose what you could have done with those 2 hours

### Money You Don't Spend Still Has Cost

Money sitting in savings:
- Earns minimal interest
- Could be invested (higher return)
- Could buy something useful
- The opportunity cost is the foregone alternative

## Examples

### Education

**Going to college:**
- Explicit cost: $40,000/year tuition
- Opportunity cost: 4 years of potential income (~$40,000/year = $160,000)
- **Total cost:** ~$320,000 over 4 years

Is the degree worth $320,000 in true cost?

### Career Choices

**Taking a stable job vs. starting a business:**
- Stable job: $100,000/year guaranteed
- Startup: Potential $10M, also potential $0

If you take the job, opportunity cost = expected value of the startup.
If you take the startup, opportunity cost = the guaranteed salary.

### Time Allocation

**Attending a meeting:**
- Explicit cost: Maybe zero
- Opportunity cost: What you would have accomplished otherwise

This is why unnecessary meetings are so expensive.

### Investments

**Keeping money in savings:**
- Earns 1%/year
- Stock market average: 7%/year
- Opportunity cost: 6% difference annually

Over 30 years, this compounds to massive differences.

### Relationships

**Staying in a mediocre relationship:**
- What you have: Known, comfortable
- Opportunity cost: The better relationship you might find

## Calculating Opportunity Cost

### Step 1: Identify All Options

What are all the realistic alternatives?

### Step 2: Value Each Option

What's each option worth? (Money, time, happiness, growth)

### Step 3: Choose the Best

Pick the highest-value option.

### Step 4: Opportunity Cost = Next Best

What you gave up = the value of Option #2.

### Step 5: Is the Difference Worth It?

Is Option #1 good enough to justify what you're losing?

## The Hidden Opportunity Costs

### Possessions

Things you own have ongoing costs:
- Storage space
- Mental overhead
- Maintenance time
- Money tied up that could be invested

### Commitments

Obligations consume future options:
- Long-term contracts limit flexibility
- Relationships require time
- Habits occupy mental space

### Skills

Learning one thing means not learning another:
- Depth in A = less breadth in B, C, D
- Specialization = giving up generalization

### Location

Being somewhere means not being elsewhere:
- Living in NYC = not living in Bali
- Each location has different opportunities

## Warren Buffett on Opportunity Cost

> "The rest of life is the same damn way. If opportunity A is better than B, and you have only one opportunity, you do A. We make decisions based on opportunity cost."

> "When you get married, you have to choose the best [spouse] you can find that will have you."

Every choice should be compared to the best alternative.

## Charlie Munger on Opportunity Cost

> "Everything is based on opportunity costs. Academia has done a terrible disservice: they teach in one sentence in first-year economics about opportunity costs, but that's it."

Opportunity cost should be central to all decision-making.

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Ignoring Opportunity Cost Entirely

Only counting explicit costs.

**Fix:** Always ask "What else could I do with this?"

### 2. Sunk Cost Confusion

Factoring in past costs that can't be recovered.

**Fix:** Only future opportunity costs matter.

### 3. Not Comparing to Best Alternative

Comparing to worst case, not best alternative.

**Fix:** What's the BEST thing you could do instead?

### 4. Ignoring Time's Opportunity Cost

Not counting what else you could do with time.

**Fix:** Your time has value—calculate it.

## Practical Applications

### Before Any Expenditure

Ask: "What else could this money buy?"

### Before Any Time Commitment

Ask: "What else could I do with this time?"

### Before Any Major Decision

Ask: "What's my best alternative?"

### When Evaluating "Free"

Ask: "Is it really free, or am I paying in time/attention/opportunity?"

## Key Takeaways

1. **Every choice has a hidden cost** - The best alternative foregone
2. **See both costs** - Explicit AND opportunity
3. **Compare to best alternative** - Not average, not worst
4. **Time has opportunity cost** - Often the biggest one
5. **"Free" isn't free** - Always has opportunity cost

## The Opportunity Cost Questions

- **"What else could I do with this?"**
- **"What's my best alternative?"**
- **"What am I really giving up?"**
- **"Is this worth what I'm not getting?"**
