## How to Use This Skill

### Step 1: Identify the Problem Category
Ask yourself:
- Is this about **understanding** something? → Volume 1 models
- Is this about **change/energy/adaptation**? → Volume 2 models
- Is this about **systems/patterns**? → Volume 3 models
- Is this about **value/communication**? → Volume 4 models

### Step 2: Select 2-3 Relevant Models
Don't use just one model. Combine multiple perspectives:
- Start with First Principles to understand the core
- Use Inversion to identify what to avoid
- Apply Second-Order Thinking to check consequences

### Step 3: Apply and Iterate
1. State the problem clearly
2. Apply each selected model
3. Look for conflicts between model outputs
4. Synthesize into actionable insight

### Example: Should I take this new job?

**First Principles:** What do I fundamentally want from work? (income, growth, meaning, flexibility)

**Second-Order Thinking:**
- 1st order: Higher salary
- 2nd order: More stress, less time for family
- 3rd order: Possible burnout, career reset needed

**Inversion:** What would make this job the worst decision? Long commute, toxic culture, dead-end role → Check if these exist

**Opportunity Cost:** What am I giving up? Current relationships, learning trajectory, unvested equity

**Circle of Competence:** Am I qualified, or will I be struggling outside my expertise?

## Quick Reference Card

2. **Second-Order Thinking** - Think ahead: "And then what?"
3. **Inversion** - Avoid failure instead of chasing success
4. **Feedback Loops** - Understand cause and effect cycles
5. **Compounding** - Small consistent actions win long-term
6. **Margin of Safety** - Always have a buffer

8. **Leverage** - Find maximum impact points
9. **Hanlon's Razor** - Assume incompetence, not malice
10. **Circle of Competence** - Know your limits

### Daily Checklist

Before any major decision, ask:
- [ ] Am I reasoning from first principles or by analogy?
- [ ] What are the second and third-order effects?
- [ ] What would I do if I wanted this to fail? (Inversion)
- [ ] What's the probability of success? What's my confidence level?
- [ ] What am I giving up by choosing this? (Opportunity Cost)
- [ ] Do I have adequate margin of safety?
- [ ] Is this within my circle of competence?

*"You only think you know, as a matter of fact. And most of your actions are based on incomplete knowledge and you really don't know what it is all about, or what the purpose of the world is, or know a great deal of other things. It is possible to live and not know."*
