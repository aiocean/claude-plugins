# Margin of Safety

> "Do not cut it close."
> — Warren Buffett

## Core Concept

**Margin of Safety** is the practice of building in a buffer between what you need and what you have—the gap that protects you when things go wrong (as they inevitably will).

It's the engineering principle of designing for extremes, not averages.

## The Fundamental Truth

**Things go wrong.** They go wrong more often than we expect. The margin of safety is how we survive our imperfect predictions.

- Bridges are built to handle far more weight than expected
- Investments should be worth more than you pay
- Schedules should have buffer for delays
- Savings should exceed expected needs

## Origins

### Engineering

Engineers don't design a bridge to handle exactly the expected load. They design for multiples of it:
- A bridge rated for 5-ton trucks might be built to handle 25 tons
- This accounts for uncertainty, material fatigue, and unexpected events

### Investing (Benjamin Graham)

Buy securities for significantly less than their calculated intrinsic value:
- If you estimate value at $100, buy at $70 or less
- The $30 gap protects against estimation errors
- You can be wrong and still not lose

## Why We Need Margin of Safety

### 1. We're Bad at Predicting

Our forecasts are consistently wrong:
- We underestimate time (planning fallacy)
- We overestimate success (optimism bias)
- We miss black swans (narrative fallacy)

### 2. The World Is Uncertain

Even good predictions face randomness:
- Unexpected events happen
- Conditions change
- Luck plays a role

### 3. Errors Compound

Multiple small errors combine into large ones:
- 10% error in each of 5 estimates = 61% total error
- Best case assumptions rarely all happen

### 4. Downside Is Often Larger

Many situations are asymmetric:
- A bridge failure is worse than over-engineering cost
- A financial wipeout is worse than smaller gains
- A missed deadline can be career-ending

## Calculating Margin of Safety

### General Formula

```
Margin of Safety = (Capacity - Requirement) / Capacity

or

Margin of Safety = What you have / What you need
```

### Examples

| Situation | Requirement | With Margin | Margin % |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| Bridge load | 10 tons | Build for 50 tons | 80% |
| Project timeline | 6 weeks | Promise 9 weeks | 33% |
| Emergency fund | 3 months expenses | Save 6 months | 50% |
| Investment | $100 value | Buy at $70 | 30% |

## Where to Apply Margin of Safety

### Time

**Always add buffer:**
- Projects take longer than expected
- Meetings run over
- Transitions need time

**Rule of thumb:** Multiply your best estimate by 1.5-2x

### Money

**Keep reserves:**
- Emergency fund (6+ months expenses)
- Don't invest money you'll need soon
- Keep credit available

**Don't cut close:** If you need $90K, have $120K.

### Relationships

**Don't max out:**
- Don't ask favors at the limit of goodwill
- Maintain more trust than you plan to draw on
- Keep relationships healthy before you need them

### Health

**Build reserves:**
- Be healthier than minimally required
- Sleep more than barely enough
- Exercise capacity beyond daily demands

### Business

**Multiple buffers:**
- Cash runway beyond projected needs
- Inventory beyond expected demand
- Capacity beyond current load
- Relationships beyond current needs

## The Cost of Margin

Margin isn't free:
- More bridge capacity = more construction cost
- Lower buying price = fewer opportunities
- Longer timelines = slower progress
- Higher reserves = less deployed capital

**The trade-off:** Cost of margin vs. cost of failure

### When to Accept Lower Margin

- Low consequences of failure
- High cost of margin
- Ability to recover quickly
- Multiple attempts possible

### When to Demand Higher Margin

- Irreversible decisions
- High consequences of failure
- Difficult recovery
- One shot only

## Margin of Safety in Practice

### Project Planning

1. Estimate time honestly
2. Multiply by 1.5x
3. Add additional buffer for unknowns
4. Communicate the padded number

### Financial Decisions

1. Calculate needed return
2. Add buffer for errors
3. Only proceed if realistic returns exceed buffered needs
4. Have reserves for when you're wrong

### Career Decisions

1. Don't quit until you have next thing
2. Keep skills current beyond current job needs
3. Maintain relationships beyond immediate utility
4. Save beyond immediate needs

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Optimism Bias

"It'll probably work out" → Plan for what happens when it doesn't

### 2. Pressure to Cut Margin

"We can't afford the buffer" → You can't afford to NOT have the buffer

### 3. Best Case Planning

"If everything goes right..." → Something won't go right

### 4. Using Average Conditions

"Traffic is usually fine" → Design for when it isn't

### 5. Margin Only in One Dimension

"We have extra time" → But no extra money when problems arise

## Key Takeaways

1. **Things go wrong** - Plan for it
2. **Build in buffer** - Between what you need and what you have
3. **Higher stakes = higher margin** - Scale buffer to consequences
4. **Margin has costs** - Balance against the cost of failure
5. **Multiple margins** - Time, money, relationships, health

## The Margin Questions

- **"What's my margin of safety here?"**
- **"What happens if I'm wrong?"**
- **"How much buffer do I have?"**
- **"Is this cutting it too close?"**
- **"What's the cost of failure vs. cost of margin?"**

- **Inversion** - What would cause failure?
- **Second-Order Thinking** - Consequences of insufficient margin
- **Probabilistic Thinking** - Things rarely go as expected
