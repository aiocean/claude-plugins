# Regression to the Mean

> "Extreme performances tend to be followed by more moderate ones."

## Core Concept

**Regression to the Mean** is the statistical phenomenon where extreme values tend to be followed by values closer to the average. Exceptional performance—good or bad—is often followed by more typical performance, regardless of any intervention.

Understanding this prevents misattributing causes to what's simply statistical normalcy.

## The Basic Insight

If someone performs unusually well or poorly, their next performance is likely to be closer to their average—not because of anything that changed, but because extreme performances are rare by definition.

**This doesn't mean:**
- Performance is determined by randomness
- Skill doesn't matter
- Interventions never work

**It does mean:**
- Extreme results involve luck (good or bad)
- Some movement toward average is expected
- We often misattribute regression to causes

## The Classic Example: Sports Illustrated Jinx

Athletes featured on the Sports Illustrated cover often perform worse afterward. Is it a curse?

**No.** They were featured BECAUSE they had an exceptional performance. Exceptional performances involve some luck. Their next performance, with average luck, is closer to their true ability—which is lower than their peak.

The cover didn't cause the decline. The selection criterion (exceptional performance) guaranteed subsequent regression.

## Where Regression Shows Up

### Business

| Scenario | What Happens |
|----------|--------------|
| Best quarter ever | Next quarter likely more normal |
| Worst quarter ever | Next quarter likely improves |
| New manager + improvement | Could be regression, not manager |
| New program + decline | Could be regression, not program |

### Health

| Scenario | What Happens |
|----------|--------------|
| Feel terrible, take medicine, feel better | Could be regression to normal |
| Extreme pain, try treatment, pain decreases | Could be regression |
| Best health day ever | Tomorrow likely more typical |

### Sports

| Scenario | What Happens |
|----------|--------------|
| Rookie of the year | Sophomore slump common |
| Career worst game | Next game likely better |
| Random player has record game | Next game likely normal |

### Relationships

| Scenario | What Happens |
|----------|--------------|
| Perfect first date | Subsequent dates more typical |
| Terrible fight | Next interaction likely better |
| "Best day of our relationship" | More normal days follow |

## The Misattribution Problem

### Example: Praise and Punishment

An Israeli flight instructor noticed:
- When he praised pilots for good landings, they did worse next time
- When he criticized bad landings, they did better next time

**His conclusion:** Criticism works, praise backfires.

**Reality:** Regression to the mean. After exceptional performance (good or bad), the next performance trends toward average—regardless of feedback given.

### Example: Medical Treatment

Patient feels terrible (extreme state). Takes a remedy. Feels better.

**Possible conclusions:**
1. The remedy worked
2. They would have improved anyway (regression)
3. Placebo effect
4. Natural healing

Many "treatments" get credit for natural regression to the mean.

### Example: Performance Improvement Programs

After worst-performing quarter, company implements new program. Performance improves.

**Possible conclusions:**
1. Program worked
2. They would have improved anyway (regression from extreme)
3. Combination of both

## How to Account for Regression

### 1. Control Groups

Compare against a group that didn't get the intervention:
- If both improve, it's regression
- If only treatment group improves, maybe the intervention worked

### 2. Multiple Measurements

Don't judge from single data points:
- One extreme performance isn't a trend
- Look at longer-term patterns
- Average over multiple instances

### 3. Baseline Comparison

Compare to long-term average, not recent extreme:
- "They improved from last month" (extreme)
- vs. "They're above their 3-year average" (meaningful)

### 4. Prediction Not Explanation

Use regression for prediction:
- Extreme performers will likely regress
- Build this into expectations
- Don't be surprised

## Practical Applications

### Hiring

After extreme interview performance:
- Stellar candidate may not be as good in practice
- Terrible candidate may not be as bad
- Factor regression into expectations

### Performance Reviews

After exceptional quarter:
- Don't over-reward what may be partly luck
- Don't over-punish bad luck
- Look at longer time periods

### Investment

After a fund's best year:
- Next year likely more moderate
- Don't chase recent performance
- Regression is more likely than trend continuation

### Personal Expectations

After your best or worst day:
- Tomorrow is likely more typical
- Don't extrapolate from extremes
- Maintain perspective

## Key Principles

### 1. Selection Effects

When you select based on extreme performance, you're selecting for both skill AND luck. The luck component regresses.

### 2. Skill Plus Luck

```
Observed Performance = Skill + Luck

If luck is positive → Observed > Skill
If luck is negative → Observed < Skill
Next time, luck averages out → Closer to Skill
```

### 3. The More Extreme, The More Regression

Very extreme results have more luck component. Expect more regression.

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Praising/Blaming Regression

Giving credit/blame for movement that's just regression.

### 2. Making Decisions from Extremes

Hiring the top performer without accounting for regression.

### 3. Expecting Trends from Outliers

Assuming exceptional performance will continue.

### 4. Misunderstanding Interventions

Thinking an intervention worked when it was just regression.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Extremes regress** - Exceptional performances are followed by more normal ones
2. **It's not causation** - Regression happens regardless of interventions
3. **Watch for misattribution** - Don't credit/blame the wrong thing
4. **Use control groups** - To distinguish regression from real effects
5. **Expect it** - Factor regression into predictions

## The Regression Questions

- **"Is this extreme result likely to persist, or regress?"**
- **"Am I attributing to a cause what might be regression?"**
- **"Would this have improved/declined anyway?"**
- **"What does the longer-term average show?"**

## Related Models

- **Causation vs Correlation** - Regression can look like causation
- **Base Rates** - The mean to which things regress
- **Probabilistic Thinking** - Luck as a component of outcomes

*"When things are at their worst, they will likely improve. When at their best, they will likely decline. Don't confuse this with your interventions working or failing."*
