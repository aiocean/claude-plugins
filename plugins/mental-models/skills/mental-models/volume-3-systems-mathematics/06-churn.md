# Churn

> "Not all change is progress, and not all stability is stagnation."

## Core Concept

**Churn** is the rate of turnover or change in a system—how quickly elements are replaced. Understanding churn helps distinguish healthy dynamism from destructive instability.

Some churn is necessary and healthy. Too much is destabilizing. Too little leads to stagnation.

## The Fundamental Truth

Systems need the right amount of change:
- **Too much churn:** Chaos, loss of institutional knowledge, constant disruption
- **Too little churn:** Stagnation, complacency, inability to adapt
- **Right amount:** Fresh perspectives while maintaining continuity

## Types of Churn

### Customer Churn
Rate at which customers leave:
- Monthly churn = Customers lost / Customers at start
- Annual churn = Total lost in year / Average customers

### Employee Churn (Turnover)
Rate at which employees leave:
- Voluntary: Resignations
- Involuntary: Terminations
- Functional: Beneficial departures

### Portfolio Churn
Rate of trading in investments:
- High churn = Frequent trading (often worse results)
- Low churn = Buy and hold (often better results)

### Idea/Strategy Churn
Rate of changing direction:
- High churn = Constant pivots
- Low churn = Consistent strategy

## Healthy vs Unhealthy Churn

### Healthy Churn

**Brings benefits:**
- Fresh perspectives and ideas
- Removes underperformers
- Brings in new skills
- Prevents stagnation
- Forces adaptation

**Examples:**
- Replacing a toxic employee
- Losing unprofitable customers
- Pruning poor strategies

### Unhealthy Churn

**Brings costs:**
- Loss of institutional knowledge
- Training and onboarding costs
- Disruption and instability
- Damaged relationships
- Wasted resources

**Examples:**
- Losing your best customers
- Top performers leaving
- Constant strategic pivots

## The Churn Trade-off

                  └────────────────────────────
                      Low   Optimal   High
                           Churn Rate
```

- Too low: Stagnation, inability to adapt
- Optimal: Fresh energy while maintaining knowledge
- Too high: Chaos, constant disruption

## Calculating Churn

### Simple Churn Rate

```
Churn Rate = (Lost in Period / Starting Count) × 100
```

**Example:** Started with 100 customers, lost 5
Churn = (5 / 100) × 100 = 5%

### Annualized Churn

```
Annual Churn = 1 - (1 - Monthly Churn)^12
```

**Example:** 2% monthly churn
Annual = 1 - (1 - 0.02)^12 = 1 - 0.785 = 21.5%

## Churn in Business

### Customer Churn

**Why it matters:**
- Acquiring customers is expensive
- Retained customers are more profitable
- Churn compounds against growth

**Reducing churn:**
- Understand why customers leave
- Address root causes
- Improve experience
- Create switching costs
- Build relationships

### Employee Churn

**Optimal range:** 5-15% annually for most organizations

**Too low signals:**
- Not exiting poor performers
- Complacency
- Low ambition

**Too high signals:**
- Culture problems
- Compensation issues
- Poor management
- Unsustainable conditions

### Strategy Churn

**Signs of too much:**
- New priorities every month
- Employees confused about direction
- Resources wasted on abandoned initiatives
- No compound progress

**Signs of too little:**
- Failing to adapt to market changes
- Missing opportunities
- Becoming obsolete

## Managing Churn

### Measuring

Track churn rates for key elements:
- Customers (by segment)
- Employees (by role, tenure, performance)
- Features (additions/removals)
- Strategy (major direction changes)

### Analyzing

Understand the causes:
- Why are they leaving?
- Is this good or bad churn?
- What's driving the rate?
- What would change it?

### Optimizing

Target the right level:
- Don't minimize churn—optimize it
- Distinguish good churn from bad
- Focus on retaining what matters
- Allow healthy turnover

## Churn and Compound Progress

**High churn = Low compounding**

Progress compounds when you build on previous work:
- Strategy churn resets the clock
- Employee churn loses institutional knowledge
- Customer churn loses relationships

**Consistency enables compounding:**
- Consistent strategy builds expertise
- Stable teams build effectiveness
- Retained customers become advocates

## Personal Churn

### Relationship Churn
- Rate of turnover in friendships
- Rate of turnover in professional network
- Are you maintaining connections?

### Knowledge Churn
- Are you continuously learning?
- Is knowledge replacing outdated knowledge?
- Balance between depth and breadth?

### Habit Churn
- Rate of adopting and abandoning habits
- Is high churn preventing habit formation?
- Are you keeping what works?

## Key Takeaways

1. **Not all churn is bad** - Some turnover is healthy
2. **Not all churn is good** - Excessive turnover is destructive
3. **Find the optimal rate** - Neither zero nor maximum
4. **Distinguish good from bad** - Losing stars vs. losing poor performers
5. **Churn disrupts compounding** - Stability enables progress

## The Churn Questions

- **"What's our churn rate here?"**
- **"Is this healthy or unhealthy churn?"**
- **"Are we churning too much or too little?"**
- **"What's causing this churn?"**
- **"What knowledge/value are we losing?"**

## Related Models

- **Compounding** - Churn disrupts compound growth
- **Equilibrium** - Healthy churn maintains dynamic equilibrium
- **Feedback Loops** - Churn can be self-reinforcing
