# Gall's Law

> "A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked."
> — John Gall

## Core Concept

**Gall's Law** states that complex systems that work always evolve from simple systems that worked first. You cannot design a complex working system from scratch—it will fail. You must start simple and iterate.

This is perhaps the most practical insight in systems theory.

## The Full Quote

> "A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system."
> — John Gall, *Systemantics*

## Why This Is True

### 1. Complexity Creates Unpredictability

Complex systems have:
- Many interacting parts
- Emergent behaviors
- Unexpected failure modes
- Dependencies that aren't obvious

You can't anticipate all the ways complexity will break.

### 2. Simple Systems Provide Feedback

A working simple system:
- Shows what actually works
- Reveals real requirements
- Exposes hidden assumptions
- Provides foundation for iteration

### 3. Evolution Works, Design Often Doesn't

Evolution:
- Makes small changes
- Tests against reality
- Keeps what works
- Discards what doesn't

Design from scratch:
- Makes many assumptions
- Tests only in theory
- Locks in decisions
- Hard to change

## Examples

### Successful Complex Systems (Evolved)

**The Internet:**
Started as ARPANET connecting a few computers. Evolved protocols. Added features. Grew organically. Now connects billions.

**Google:**
Started as a simple search algorithm. Added features incrementally. Each addition built on working foundation.

**Amazon:**
Started selling books online. Added categories. Added AWS. Added Prime. Each built on what worked.

### Failed Complex Systems (Designed From Scratch)

**Healthcare.gov (initial launch):**
Tried to build a complex system from scratch. Crashed spectacularly. Had to be rebuilt incrementally.

**Many Enterprise Software Projects:**
Attempt to build complete systems before testing. Fail due to complexity. Must restart simpler.

**New Cities (Some):**
Planned cities sometimes fail because they're designed in complete form rather than evolved from organic growth.

## Implications

### Start Simple

Whatever you're building:
1. Start with the simplest version that could work
2. Get it working
3. Add complexity only as needed
4. Maintain a working system at each step

### Evolve, Don't Design

Don't try to anticipate everything:
1. Build a working simple thing
2. Learn from it
3. Iterate based on reality
4. Let complexity emerge naturally

### Respect Working Systems

Before replacing a working system:
1. Understand why it works
2. Don't assume you can design better from scratch
3. Evolve incrementally if possible
4. Keep the old system running until new one is proven

### Test Early and Often

At each stage:
1. Verify it still works
2. Catch problems early
3. Don't let complexity accumulate untested
4. Maintain ability to revert

## Application: Software Development

### Waterfall (Violates Gall's Law)
1. Design everything upfront
2. Build to spec
3. Test at the end
4. Hope it works

**Result:** Often doesn't work. Expensive to fix.

### Agile/Iterative (Follows Gall's Law)
1. Build simplest working version
2. Test immediately
3. Add features incrementally
4. Always maintain working system

**Result:** More likely to produce working complex system.

### The MVP Approach

Minimum Viable Product embodies Gall's Law:
1. What's the simplest thing that could work?
2. Build that
3. Learn from real users
4. Iterate based on reality

## Application: Organizations

### Growing Organizations

Successful companies often:
1. Start with founder(s) doing everything
2. Add roles as needed
3. Add processes when pain requires them
4. Evolve structure organically

Unsuccessful attempts often:
1. Try to install "enterprise" structure immediately
2. Create processes before understanding needs
3. Over-organize before complexity requires it

### Organizational Change

Successful change often:
1. Starts with small experiments
2. Proves the approach works
3. Expands incrementally
4. Maintains stability throughout

Failed change often:
1. Attempts total transformation
2. Designs new structure from scratch
3. Implements wholesale
4. Breaks the existing system

## Application: Personal Life

### Habits

Building habits:
1. Start with tiny habit
2. Get it consistent
3. Expand gradually
4. Maintain what works

NOT:
1. Design complete lifestyle overhaul
2. Implement all at once
3. Fail
4. Give up

### Learning

Acquiring skills:
1. Learn basics first
2. Get them working
3. Add complexity gradually
4. Build on foundation

NOT:
1. Try to learn everything at once
2. Jump to advanced material
3. Struggle without foundation
4. Get overwhelmed

## Common Violations

### "If We're Going to Do It, Let's Do It Right"

This often leads to over-engineering from the start. Better: Do it simply first, make it right through iteration.

### "We Need to Plan This Thoroughly"

Extensive planning often delays learning from reality. Better: Plan enough to start, then adapt.

### "Let's Build the Platform, Then the Features"

Platform-first development often fails. Better: Build features, discover patterns, extract platform.

### "We Should Rebuild From Scratch"

"If I were building this from scratch, I'd do it differently" → Almost always underestimates complexity of working system.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Simple first, complex later** - Always start with something simple that works
2. **Evolve, don't design** - Let complexity emerge through iteration
3. **Keep it working** - Never let the system get into broken state
4. **Reality over theory** - Learn from working systems, not from plans
5. **Respect existing systems** - They contain hidden knowledge

## The Gall's Law Questions

- **"What's the simplest version of this that could work?"**
- **"Is this already too complex?"**
- **"Do we have a working foundation?"**
- **"Are we trying to design complexity from scratch?"**
