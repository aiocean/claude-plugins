# Bottlenecks

## Core Concept

A **Bottleneck** is the point in a system that limits overall throughput. No matter how much you improve other parts, the system's output is constrained by the bottleneck.

Identifying and relieving bottlenecks is one of the highest-leverage improvements you can make.

## The Fundamental Truth

**System output = Bottleneck throughput**

Everything else is secondary:
- Improving non-bottlenecks doesn't help
- Resources spent elsewhere are wasted
- The bottleneck determines everything

## The Theory of Constraints

Eliyahu Goldratt's framework:

### Step 1: Identify the Bottleneck
Where is the constraint? What limits flow?

### Step 2: Exploit the Bottleneck
Get maximum output from the constraint as-is:
- Ensure it's never idle
- Prioritize its time
- Protect it from non-essential work

### Step 3: Subordinate Everything Else
Other parts should serve the bottleneck:
- Feed it what it needs
- Don't overproduce upstream (creates waste)
- Pace work to the bottleneck's capacity

### Step 4: Elevate the Bottleneck
Increase its capacity:
- Add resources
- Improve efficiency
- Remove obstacles

### Step 5: Repeat
Once you fix one bottleneck, another emerges. Go back to Step 1.

## Identifying Bottlenecks

### Signs of a Bottleneck

1. **Inventory piles up before it:** Work waiting to be processed
2. **Starvation after it:** Downstream is idle, waiting for input
3. **It's always busy:** 100% utilization while others have slack
4. **Everyone's waiting on it:** Requests queue up

### Finding the Constraint

Ask:
- Where do things pile up?
- Where are people always waiting?
- What's always the holdup?
- If we magically doubled this, would output increase?

## Types of Bottlenecks

### Physical Bottlenecks
- Manufacturing equipment capacity
- Physical space limitations
- Transportation capacity
- Network bandwidth

### Resource Bottlenecks
- Key personnel time
- Specialized skills
- Capital availability
- Raw material supply

### Policy Bottlenecks
- Approval processes
- Regulatory requirements
- Company rules
- Contractual limitations

### Knowledge Bottlenecks
- Expertise concentration
- Information access
- Decision-making authority
- Tribal knowledge

## Common Business Bottlenecks

| Area | Common Bottlenecks |
|------|-------------------|
| **Development** | Senior developers, QA, deployment process |
| **Sales** | Lead generation, demos, contract review |
| **Support** | Specialists, escalation handling |
| **Operations** | Specific equipment, trained operators |
| **Management** | Executive time, decision-making |

## Bottleneck Management Strategies

### Don't Waste the Bottleneck

If the bottleneck is down, nothing flows. Protect it:
- Never let it wait for inputs
- Schedule around its availability
- Don't waste its capacity on low-value work

### Buffer Before the Bottleneck

Ensure the bottleneck always has work:
- Keep a queue of prioritized tasks
- Prevent starvation from upstream failures
- Balance protection against WIP waste

### Control the Pace

Everything should work at the bottleneck's pace:
- Faster upstream just creates inventory
- Match input rate to bottleneck capacity
- "Drum-Buffer-Rope" system

### Reduce Bottleneck Workload

Some work doesn't need the bottleneck:
- Delegate what can be delegated
- Automate routine parts
- Filter before reaching the bottleneck

### Increase Bottleneck Capacity

Long-term solutions:
- Add parallel capacity (hire, buy equipment)
- Improve efficiency (training, tools)
- Redesign process (eliminate need for bottleneck)

## Personal Bottleneck Analysis

### Time Bottlenecks
- What activities constrain your output?
- Where do tasks pile up?
- What can only you do?

### Energy Bottlenecks
- When do you have capacity for deep work?
- What depletes your capacity?
- What restores it?

### Skill Bottlenecks
- What can you not do that limits you?
- What do you do poorly that slows you down?
- What should you learn or delegate?

## The Shifting Bottleneck

**Warning:** Fixing one bottleneck reveals another.

This is expected and good:
- It means you made progress
- There's always a constraint somewhere
- Continuous improvement is ongoing

**Strategy:** Don't over-invest in fixing one bottleneck before confirming what the next one will be.

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Optimizing Non-Bottlenecks
Improving fast parts doesn't help:
- Looks productive but isn't
- Creates inventory (waste)
- Doesn't increase output

### 2. Ignoring Hidden Bottlenecks
Bottlenecks aren't always obvious:
- Policy constraints masquerade as resource constraints
- Knowledge bottlenecks hide in individuals
- Cultural bottlenecks seem unchangeable

### 3. Creating New Bottlenecks
"Solving" by shifting rather than fixing:
- Adding steps that become constraints
- Centralizing decisions
- Creating dependencies

### 4. Breaking the Bottleneck Too Much
Sometimes the bottleneck serves a purpose:
- Quality control
- Pacing (prevents overload)
- Strategic review

## Key Takeaways

1. **Find the constraint** - System output = bottleneck output
2. **Exploit first, elevate later** - Get more from what you have before adding
3. **Subordinate everything else** - Non-bottleneck optimization is waste
4. **Expect shifting** - New bottlenecks emerge when old ones are fixed
5. **Not all bottlenecks are bad** - Some serve important purposes

## The Bottleneck Questions

- **"What's limiting output right now?"**
- **"If I doubled this, would output double?"**
- **"Where is work piling up?"**
- **"What is everyone waiting on?"**
- **"Am I optimizing a non-bottleneck?"**
