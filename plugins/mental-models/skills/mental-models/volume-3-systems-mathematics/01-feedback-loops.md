# Feedback Loops

> "What goes around comes around—sometimes amplified, sometimes dampened."

## Core Concept

A **Feedback Loop** occurs when the output of a system becomes an input to that same system, creating a cycle. The effect of an action feeds back to influence future actions.

Feedback loops are everywhere: in nature, organizations, markets, relationships, and your own behavior.

## Two Types of Feedback Loops

### Reinforcing (Positive) Feedback Loops

Amplifies change—more leads to more (or less leads to less):

```
More A → More B → More A → More B...
    ↑                         │
    └─────────────────────────┘
```

**Examples:**
- Compound interest: More money → More interest → More money
- Viral growth: More users → More sharing → More users
- Learning: More knowledge → More learning capacity → More knowledge
- Bank runs: Some withdrawals → Panic → More withdrawals

### Balancing (Negative) Feedback Loops

Stabilizes toward equilibrium—change triggers counter-change:

```
More A → More B → Less A → Less B...
    ↑                         │
    └─────────────────────────┘
```

**Examples:**
- Thermostat: Too hot → Cooling kicks in → Temperature drops
- Market prices: High price → Less demand → Price drops
- Hunger: Low blood sugar → Eat → Blood sugar rises → Stop eating
- Team workload: Too much work → Hire more → Work per person drops

## Why Feedback Loops Matter

### 1. They Create Non-Linear Effects

Small changes can have huge consequences:
- 1% daily improvement compounds to 37x in a year
- A small viral coefficient change dramatically affects total reach
- Minor trust erosion can collapse relationships

### 2. They Explain Surprising Outcomes

Why things accelerate suddenly or resist change:
- Tipping points (reinforcing loops dominate)
- Stubborn stability (balancing loops dominate)
- Oscillations (loops compete)

### 3. They're the Levers of Change

Want to change a system? Change its feedback loops:
- Add reinforcing loops for growth
- Add balancing loops for stability
- Interrupt destructive loops

## Common Feedback Loops

### Virtuous Cycles (Positive Reinforcing)

| Loop | Mechanism |
|------|-----------|
| **Skill → Opportunity → Skill** | Better skills get more opportunities to practice |
| **Reputation → Trust → Reputation** | Good reputation builds trust, which enhances reputation |
| **Network → Value → Network** | More connections increase value, attracting more connections |
| **Profit → Investment → Profit** | Profits fund improvements that generate more profit |

### Vicious Cycles (Negative Reinforcing)

| Loop | Mechanism |
|------|-----------|
| **Debt → Interest → Debt** | Debt grows through interest |
| **Fear → Avoidance → Fear** | Avoiding scary things increases fear |
| **Stress → Poor performance → Stress** | Stress hurts performance, causing more stress |
| **Distrust → Conflict → Distrust** | Distrust creates conflict, reinforcing distrust |

### Balancing Loops

| Loop | Mechanism |
|------|-----------|
| **Temperature → Sweating → Temperature** | Body regulates temperature |
| **Hunger → Eating → Hunger** | Body regulates food intake |
| **Price → Supply/Demand → Price** | Markets regulate prices |
| **Workload → Hiring → Workload** | Organizations regulate capacity |

## Identifying Feedback Loops

### Questions to Ask

1. What are the outputs of this system?
2. Do any outputs become inputs?
3. Does more of X lead to more of X? (Reinforcing)
4. Does more of X lead to less of X? (Balancing)
5. How long is the delay between cause and effect?

### Drawing Feedback Loops

**Reinforcing loop:** Use (+) or (R)
```
     (+)
A ────────→ B
↑           │
│    (R)    │
└───────────┘
```

**Balancing loop:** Use (-) or (B)
```
     (+)
A ────────→ B
↑           │
│    (B)    │(-)
└───────────┘
```

## Delays in Feedback

Many loops have significant delays between action and feedback:

- **Hiring:** Takes months to see the effect
- **Learning:** Takes years to compound significantly
- **Health:** Takes decades to see consequences
- **Environment:** Takes generations to see full impact

### Why Delays Matter

1. **We overshoot:** By the time we see results, we've gone too far
2. **We give up too early:** Results aren't visible yet
3. **We attribute wrongly:** The cause was much earlier
4. **We oscillate:** Constant over-correction

## Manipulating Feedback Loops

### To Create Growth (Strengthen Reinforcing)

1. **Identify the loop:** What leads to more of what?
2. **Accelerate the cycle:** Remove friction
3. **Shorten delays:** Faster feedback
4. **Add more fuel:** More input at each step

### To Create Stability (Strengthen Balancing)

1. **Identify the goal:** What equilibrium do you want?
2. **Create sensors:** How will you know when you're off?
3. **Create correctors:** What brings you back?
4. **Reduce delays:** Faster correction

### To Stop Destructive Loops

1. **Identify the loop:** What's creating the spiral?
2. **Find intervention points:** Where can you break the cycle?
3. **Introduce balancing forces:** What would counter the spiral?
4. **Accept transition costs:** Breaking loops isn't free

## Feedback in Personal Life

### Habit Loops
- Cue → Routine → Reward → Cue...
- The reward reinforces responding to the cue
- Breaking habits means interrupting the loop

### Relationship Loops
- Trust → Vulnerability → Connection → Trust... (virtuous)
- Criticism → Defense → Distance → Criticism... (vicious)
- Which loops are you in?

### Career Loops
- Performance → Opportunity → Skills → Performance... (virtuous)
- Fear → Avoidance → Stagnation → Fear... (vicious)
- Which loops do you want to strengthen?

## Key Takeaways

1. **Loops shape systems** - Feedback loops explain much of system behavior
2. **Reinforcing loops compound** - For better or worse
3. **Balancing loops stabilize** - Toward a set point
4. **Delays create problems** - Overshooting, undershooting, oscillation
5. **You can design loops** - Strengthen good ones, break bad ones

## The Feedback Questions

- **"What loops are operating in this system?"**
- **"Is this loop reinforcing or balancing?"**
- **"How long are the delays?"**
- **"How can I strengthen good loops or break bad ones?"**
