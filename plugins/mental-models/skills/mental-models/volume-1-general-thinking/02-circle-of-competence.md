# Circle of Competence

> "You only have to be able to evaluate companies within your circle of competence. The size of that circle is not very important; knowing its boundaries, however, is vital."
> — Warren Buffett

## Core Concept

Your **Circle of Competence** is the area where you have deep, earned knowledge that gives you a genuine edge. Inside this circle, you can make decisions with confidence and predict outcomes reliably. Outside this circle, you're operating with incomplete understanding and competing against people who have the advantage.

The concept was popularized by **Warren Buffett** in his 1996 shareholder letter, though Charlie Munger has also championed it extensively.

## The Fundamental Truth

We all have areas of expertise built through years of study and experience. The key insight is not how large your circle is, but knowing exactly where its boundaries are.

### The Three Zones

## Why This Matters

### 1. Confidence Doesn't Match Competence

As we cross the perimeter from what we know to what we don't, **confidence does not diminish as fast as competence**. This is the danger zone - we feel certain while being wrong.

The Dunning-Kruger effect is real: those with limited knowledge often overestimate their abilities, while experts tend to underestimate theirs.

### 2. Playing Outside Your Circle = Giving Others the Advantage

> "By and large, we haven't invested in pharmaceuticals because we've got no edge. I don't know enough about biology and medicine and chemistry to have any edge... Why in the hell would I play against other people in a game where they're much better at it than I am?"
> — Charlie Munger

When you operate outside your circle:
- You compete against specialists
- You don't see what you're missing
- You make beginner mistakes
- You can't distinguish good advice from bad

### 3. Knowing Your Limits is Wisdom

The most dangerous part of being outside your circle isn't making mistakes—it's not knowing you're making mistakes.

## Identifying Your Circle

### Questions to Assess Your Competence

Ask yourself:
1. **Time invested:** Have I spent years studying/practicing this?
2. **Feedback received:** Have I gotten real-world feedback on my decisions?
3. **Track record:** What's my actual success rate in this area?
4. **Edge awareness:** Can I identify what others miss?
5. **Failure understanding:** Do I understand how things fail here?

### Signs You're Inside Your Circle

- You can explain the nuances to a beginner
- You know what questions to ask
- You can predict likely outcomes
- You recognize patterns others miss
- You know the limitations of your knowledge
- You can identify quality vs mediocrity

### Signs You're Outside Your Circle

- You're relying on others' opinions without understanding the reasoning
- You don't know what questions to ask
- You can't distinguish between good and bad advice
- You're surprised by outcomes frequently
- You're uncomfortable explaining your reasoning

## Real-World Examples

### Michael Phelps vs Hicham El Guerrouj

Michael Phelps has won more Olympic medals than anyone. But in running, he'd lose to most amateur runners. Similarly, El Guerrouj was one of history's greatest runners but couldn't qualify as an Olympic swimmer. Both succeeded by **staying in their circles**.

### Warren Buffett and Tech Stocks

For decades, Buffett avoided technology investments, saying they were outside his circle of competence. He didn't understand the businesses deeply enough to predict their futures. He missed some opportunities, but he also avoided many disasters.

When he finally invested in Apple, it was because he understood it as a consumer products company (within his circle) rather than a technology company.

### The Surgeon's Expertise

A surgeon has a circle built from a decade of study and thousands of surgeries. You cannot read a few books and approximate this competence. Their circle is specialized and hard-earned.

## How to Apply This Model

### Step 1: Map Your Current Circle

Write down areas where you have genuine expertise:
- What have you studied deeply?
- What do you have real-world experience in?
- Where do you have a track record of success?
- What do people seek your advice on?

### Step 2: Identify the Edges

For each area, ask:
- Where does my knowledge become uncertain?
- What adjacent areas am I not qualified to judge?
- What do I assume I know but haven't verified?

### Step 3: Operate Within the Circle

- **Make major decisions** only in areas of competence
- **Seek experts** for decisions outside your circle
- **Say "I don't know"** when you genuinely don't

### Step 4: Expand Deliberately

You can grow your circle, but it requires:
- **Deep work:** Surface-level exposure doesn't build competence
- **Adjacent growth:** Expand into areas connected to current expertise
- **Feedback loops:** Real-world testing and iteration
- **Time:** There are no shortcuts to genuine expertise

## Expanding Your Circle

### Do's

- Start with adjacent knowledge connected to existing expertise
- Focus on deliberate practice at the edge of your abilities
- Seek immediate, honest feedback
- Teach others to expose gaps in your understanding
- Set goals that force you to expand by necessity

### Don'ts

- Mistake exposure for expertise (reading about investing ≠ being a good investor)
- Expand randomly without building connected knowledge
- Assume competence transfers across domains
- Rush the learning process

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Ego Protection

It's uncomfortable to admit ignorance. But saying "I don't know" is far better than pretending competence you don't have.

### 2. Competence Decay

Skills atrophy without use. What was once inside your circle can drift outside if you're not actively maintaining it.

### 3. False Confidence from Past Success

Success in one area doesn't transfer to another. A brilliant surgeon might be a terrible investor. A great athlete might be a poor coach.

### 4. Expanding Too Fast

Trying to grow your circle too quickly leads to surface-level knowledge with dangerous overconfidence.

## The "I Don't Know" Power

The three most important words for staying within your circle:

**"I don't know."**

Saying this:
- Protects you from bad decisions
- Invites help from those who do know
- Builds trust (people respect intellectual honesty)
- Creates learning opportunities

## Key Takeaways

1. **Know your boundaries** - The size of your circle matters less than knowing where it ends
2. **Operate inside** - Make major decisions only where you have genuine competence
3. **Seek help outside** - Partner with experts for areas outside your circle
4. **Expand deliberately** - Grow through adjacent learning and real feedback
5. **Admit ignorance** - "I don't know" is strength, not weakness

*"If you want to improve your odds of success in life and business, define the perimeter of your circle of competence and operate inside. Over time, work to expand that circle but never fool yourself about where it stands today, and never be afraid to say 'I don't know.'"*
