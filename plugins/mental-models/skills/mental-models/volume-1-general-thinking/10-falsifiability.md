# Falsifiability

> "A theory that explains everything, explains nothing."
> — Karl Popper

## Core Concept

**Falsifiability** is the principle that for a claim to be scientific (or useful), it must be possible to prove it wrong. If there's no conceivable evidence that could disprove a statement, it's not a meaningful claim about reality.

Introduced by philosopher **Karl Popper**, this concept separates genuine knowledge-building from untestable speculation.

## The Fundamental Truth

A theory gains credibility not from being proven right, but from **surviving attempts to prove it wrong**.

**Strong theories:**
- Make specific, testable predictions
- Can be proven wrong by evidence
- Risk being refuted with each test

**Weak theories:**
- Are vague enough to fit any outcome
- Cannot be tested
- Explain everything by explaining nothing

## Examples

### Falsifiable Statements

| Statement | How to Falsify |
|-----------|----------------|
| "Water boils at 100°C at sea level" | Heat water at sea level, measure temperature |
| "This medication reduces symptoms in 80% of patients" | Run a clinical trial, measure outcomes |
| "Our conversion rate will increase 20% with redesign" | Implement redesign, measure conversion |
| "Species evolve through natural selection" | Find a fossil in the wrong geological layer |

### Non-Falsifiable Statements

| Statement | Why Unfalsifiable |
|-----------|-------------------|
| "Everything happens for a reason" | Any outcome can be claimed to have a reason |
| "He would have won if he'd tried harder" | We can never know what "trying harder" would produce |
| "The market will either go up or correct" | Both outcomes covered |
| "You attracted this through your energy" | Any outcome attributed to your "energy" |

## Why This Matters

### 1. Separating Knowledge from Belief

Falsifiable claims can be tested and improved. Unfalsifiable claims remain frozen opinions that can never be refined.

### 2. Avoiding Confirmation Bias

If you only look for evidence supporting your view, you'll find it. Falsifiability forces you to look for evidence against your view.

### 3. Making Real Progress

Science advances by disproving theories, not proving them. Each disproven theory narrows down what's actually true.

### 4. Detecting Pseudo-Knowledge

Many impressive-sounding ideas are unfalsifiable:
- "The universe has a purpose"
- "Success comes to those who believe"
- "They would have succeeded if conditions were different"

These might be true, but we have no way to test them.

## How to Apply Falsifiability

### Step 1: State the Claim Clearly
Vague claims are hard to falsify. Make the claim specific.

**Vague:** "This will improve performance"
**Specific:** "This will increase load time by 30% within 2 weeks"

### Step 2: Ask "What Would Prove This Wrong?"
For every theory, hypothesis, or belief, ask:
- What evidence would I need to see to abandon this belief?
- What would prove this wrong?

If you can't answer, the claim may be unfalsifiable.

### Step 3: Actually Look for Disconfirming Evidence
Don't just wait for evidence to appear. Actively seek it:
- Look for counter-examples
- Test edge cases
- Ask critics for their best arguments

### Step 4: Update Based on Evidence
If evidence contradicts your theory, update the theory. Don't explain away disconfirming evidence.

## Red Flags: Unfalsifiable Patterns

### The Post-Hoc Explanation
Whatever happens, it fits the theory:
- Stock went up? "I told you so"
- Stock went down? "Market manipulation"

### The Unfailable Guru
Any prediction failure is explained away:
- "The timing was wrong"
- "There were interfering factors"
- "You didn't believe hard enough"

### The Moving Goalposts
When predictions fail, the criteria change:
- "Well, I meant in the long term"
- "That doesn't count because..."

### The Retroactive Prediction
After the fact, the outcome is "explained" by the theory:
- "I knew that was going to happen" (but didn't say it beforehand)

## Business Applications

### Strategy Evaluation

**Weak strategy claim:** "This pivot will position us for success"
- Not falsifiable: success is undefined, timeframe unclear

**Strong strategy claim:** "This pivot will increase revenue 15% in Q3"
- Falsifiable: We can measure Q3 revenue

### Product Development

**Weak hypothesis:** "Users will love this feature"
- Not measurable

**Strong hypothesis:** "This feature will increase daily active users by 10%"
- Testable with data

### Hiring

**Weak claim:** "They're a culture fit"
- How would you prove this wrong?

**Strong claim:** "They will achieve targets in first 6 months"
- Measurable outcome

### Performance Reviews

**Weak feedback:** "You need to be more of a team player"
- What would prove you ARE a team player?

**Strong feedback:** "You need to share status updates in standup and respond to peer requests within 24 hours"
- Observable, measurable

## The Falsifiability Test

For any claim, ask these questions:

1. **What would prove this wrong?**
   - If nothing could prove it wrong, it's not a useful claim

2. **Is the claim specific enough to test?**
   - "Better" isn't testable; "20% better by metric X" is

3. **Are we actually looking for disconfirming evidence?**
   - Or just collecting confirming evidence?

4. **Would we accept a negative result?**
   - Or would we explain it away?

## Personal Applications

### Self-Beliefs

**Unfalsifiable:** "I'm not lucky"
- Every success: "That was an exception"
- Every failure: "See, I'm unlucky"

**Falsifiable:** "I will apply to 20 opportunities this month"
- Success or failure will be evident

### Relationship Assumptions

**Unfalsifiable:** "They don't care about me"
- Attention: "They're just pretending"
- Inattention: "See, they don't care"

**Falsifiable:** "If I express my needs, they will respond within a reasonable timeframe"
- Testable proposition

## The Science Mindset

Karl Popper's insight was that science doesn't prove things true; it **fails to prove them false**.

Each test a theory survives increases our confidence, but a single genuine counter-example can overturn centuries of belief.

This is the strength of science: **it can be wrong**, and therefore it can get closer to truth.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Demand falsifiability** - If nothing could prove it wrong, it's not useful knowledge
2. **Make specific predictions** - Vague claims can't be tested
3. **Seek disconfirmation** - Actively look for evidence against your beliefs
4. **Update on evidence** - When wrong, change your mind
5. **Beware unfalsifiable gurus** - If their predictions can't fail, they're not making real predictions

## The Ultimate Question

For every belief you hold strongly:

**"What would I need to see to change my mind?"**

If you can't answer, you might be holding a belief, not knowledge.
