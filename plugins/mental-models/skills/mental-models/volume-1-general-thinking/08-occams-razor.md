# Occam's Razor

> "Entities should not be multiplied beyond necessity."
> — William of Ockham

## Core Concept

**Occam's Razor** states that among competing explanations, the one with the fewest assumptions should be preferred. When you have two theories that explain the same evidence, choose the simpler one.

Named after **William of Ockham**, a 14th-century Franciscan friar and philosopher, this principle serves as a mental "razor" to cut away unnecessary complexity.

## The Fundamental Truth

Simple explanations are more likely to be correct because:
1. They have fewer points of failure
2. They're easier to test
3. Each additional assumption adds another chance to be wrong
4. Reality tends toward elegance over convolution

**Important caveat:** Simple doesn't always mean correct. Sometimes reality IS complex. Occam's Razor is a starting point, not a universal truth.

## How to Apply the Principle

### The Key Question

When evaluating explanations, ask:
**"How many assumptions does this explanation require?"**

Choose the explanation with fewer assumptions—unless there's specific evidence requiring the complexity.

### Counting Assumptions

**Scenario:** Your colleague didn't respond to your email.

**Complex explanation (many assumptions):**
1. They saw your email
2. They're angry at you
3. They're intentionally ignoring you
4. They're planning to undermine you

**Simple explanation (few assumptions):**
1. They're busy and haven't gotten to it yet

Occam's Razor suggests starting with the simpler explanation.

## Real-World Applications

### Medical Diagnosis

**Principle in medicine:** "When you hear hoofbeats, think horses, not zebras."

**Patient has a headache:**
- Simple explanation: Stress, dehydration, or lack of sleep
- Complex explanation: Brain tumor

Start with simple causes. Only pursue complex diagnoses if simple ones are ruled out.

### Technical Troubleshooting

**Website is slow:**
- Simple explanation: High traffic, server overload
- Complex explanation: Sophisticated DDoS attack with multiple vectors

Check simple causes first before assuming complex attacks.

### Business Analysis

**Sales declined this quarter:**
- Simple explanation: Seasonal pattern, fewer selling days
- Complex explanation: Market disruption, competitor conspiracy, changing demographics

Investigate simple explanations before building complex theories.

### Scientific Theory

Einstein embraced this principle:
> "The supreme goal of all theory is to make the irreducible basic elements as simple and as few as possible without having to surrender the adequate representation of a single datum of experience."

Or as he summarized: "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler."

## The Razor in Action

### Crime Investigation

**The crime:** A valuable painting is missing from a museum.

**Complex theory:** An international art theft ring with inside connections, specialized equipment, and multiple accomplices staged an elaborate heist.

**Simple theory:** A staff member took it, knowing the security gaps.

Investigate the simple theory first. Most art thefts are inside jobs.

### Relationship Issues

**The situation:** Your friend has been distant lately.

**Complex theory:** They heard something about you, are plotting with mutual friends, and are orchestrating social exclusion.

**Simple theory:** They're dealing with personal issues unrelated to you.

The simpler explanation is usually correct.

### Project Failures

**The situation:** A project missed its deadline.

**Complex theory:** Multiple departments conspired to undermine the project, the timeline was politically motivated, and sabotage occurred.

**Simple theory:** The original estimate was too optimistic, and scope crept.

Start with scope creep and bad estimates—the usual culprits.

## Limitations of Occam's Razor

### 1. Simplicity Is Subjective

What counts as "simpler" isn't always clear. Is one complex assumption simpler than three simple assumptions?

### 2. Sometimes Reality Is Complex

**Example:** Germ theory of disease seemed more complex than "bad air" theory but turned out to be correct.

**Example:** Evolution through natural selection required many assumptions but proved true.

Occam's Razor is a heuristic, not a law.

### 3. Domain Matters

In some domains (particle physics, for example), simple explanations have often been wrong. The universe at small scales is genuinely weird.

### 4. Evidence Can Override

If you have specific evidence pointing to a complex explanation, the evidence wins. Occam's Razor applies when evidence is equal.

## Occam's Razor vs. Other Razors

| Razor | Principle |
|-------|-----------|
| **Occam's Razor** | Prefer simpler explanations |
| **Hanlon's Razor** | Assume incompetence before malice |
| **Hitchens's Razor** | What can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence |
| **Alder's Razor** | If something cannot be settled by experiment, it's not worth debating |

## How to Use Occam's Razor Properly

### Step 1: List All Possible Explanations
Generate multiple hypotheses without judging them yet.

### Step 2: Count Assumptions
For each explanation, list the assumptions it requires.

### Step 3: Start with the Simplest
Investigate the explanation with fewest assumptions first.

### Step 4: Test and Eliminate
If simple explanations don't hold up to testing, move to more complex ones.

### Step 5: Accept Complexity When Needed
If evidence demands a complex explanation, accept it.

## Practical Applications

### Debugging Code

**Bug:** Application crashes intermittently.

**Complex theory:** Race conditions in multi-threaded operations combined with memory leaks and OS-level issues.

**Simple theory:** Null pointer exception in a common code path.

Check the simple things first: Look at error logs, check for obvious bugs.

### Investment Decisions

**Stock dropped 20%:**

**Complex theory:** Market manipulation, short seller conspiracies, coordinated attacks.

**Simple theory:** Earnings missed expectations.

Most stock movements have simple explanations.

### Personal Decisions

**Why didn't I get the job?**

**Complex theory:** Politics, nepotism, age discrimination, bad references.

**Simple theory:** Another candidate was more qualified or a better fit.

The simple explanation is usually sufficient.

## Warning Signs You're Overcomplicating

1. Your explanation requires "they" to coordinate complex actions
2. Multiple unlikely things must be true simultaneously
3. You're adding assumptions to preserve a preferred explanation
4. The explanation is unfalsifiable
5. You're ignoring simpler explanations without ruling them out

## Key Takeaways

1. **Start simple** - Begin with the explanation requiring fewest assumptions
2. **Test before adding complexity** - Only add assumptions when simple explanations fail
3. **Simple ≠ Always correct** - It's a starting point, not a guarantee
4. **Watch for complexity bias** - We're often attracted to complex, dramatic explanations
5. **Evidence overrides** - When evidence points to complexity, follow the evidence

## The Einstein Standard

Make things as simple as possible, **but not simpler**.

Oversimplification is also a mistake. The goal is the minimum complexity needed to explain the observations.
