# Inversion

> "Invert, always invert."
> — Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi

> "All I want to know is where I'm going to die, so I'll never go there."

## Core Concept

**Inversion** is the practice of approaching problems backward. Instead of asking "How do I achieve success?", you ask "What would guarantee failure?" and then avoid those things.

By flipping the problem around, you often discover insights that forward thinking misses entirely.

## The Fundamental Truth

It's often easier to identify what **doesn't** work than what does. Avoiding stupidity is frequently more achievable than achieving brilliance.

As Charlie Munger puts it:
> "It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent."

## Origins

The German mathematician **Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi** was famous for solving difficult problems by inverting them. His advice: "Man muss immer umkehren" ("One must always invert").

**Charlie Munger**, Warren Buffett's partner, adopted this principle for investing and life decisions, making it one of his most recommended mental models.

## How Inversion Works

### The Two Approaches

**Forward Thinking (Standard):**
"How do I make this project successful?"
→ Identify success factors
→ Pursue them

**Inverted Thinking:**
"How would I guarantee this project fails?"
→ Identify failure factors
→ Avoid them

Both are valuable. Inversion often reveals blind spots that forward thinking misses.

## How to Apply Inversion

### Step 1: State Your Goal
"I want to build a great team"

### Step 2: Invert the Goal
"How would I guarantee I build a terrible team?"

### Step 3: List Failure Causes
- Hire people who don't get along
- Micromanage everything
- Never give feedback
- Take credit for others' work
- Tolerate poor performers
- Create unclear expectations
- Pit team members against each other
- Ignore work-life balance

### Step 4: Invert the List to Create Anti-Goals
- Hire for culture fit
- Give autonomy
- Provide regular feedback
- Share credit generously
- Address underperformance quickly
- Set clear expectations
- Foster collaboration
- Respect work-life balance

### Step 5: Check Your Current Approach
Am I doing any of the things on the failure list?

## Real-World Applications

### In Investing (Buffett/Munger)

**Standard approach:** "How do I make money in the stock market?"

**Inverted approach:** "How do I lose money in the stock market?"
- Trade frequently (fees eat returns)
- Follow the crowd (buy high, sell low)
- Invest in what I don't understand
- Use excessive leverage
- React emotionally to short-term news
- Ignore valuation
- Don't diversify

**Buffett's Two Rules:**
1. Never lose money
2. Never forget Rule #1

This is inversion: Instead of maximizing gains, minimize losses.

### In Relationships

**Standard:** "How do I have a happy marriage?"

**Inverted:** "How would I guarantee an unhappy marriage?"
- Never listen
- Always need to be right
- Stop showing appreciation
- Take partner for granted
- Avoid difficult conversations
- Keep score
- Prioritize everything else above the relationship

**Action:** Avoid these things.

### In Health

**Standard:** "How do I live a long, healthy life?"

**Inverted:** "How would I guarantee poor health?"
- Smoke
- Never exercise
- Eat only processed food
- Sleep 4 hours a night
- Never manage stress
- Ignore warning signs
- Avoid doctors

**Action:** Don't do these things. The basics of good health emerge from inverting bad health.

### In Business

**Standard:** "How do I build a successful company?"

**Inverted:** "How would I guarantee failure?"
- Ignore customers
- Hire the wrong people
- Run out of cash
- Build products nobody wants
- Move too slowly
- Don't adapt to market changes
- Fight with co-founders

**Insight:** Most startups fail from things on this list, not from failing to do something brilliant.

### In Productivity

**Standard:** "How do I have a productive day?"

**Inverted:** "How would I waste an entire day?"
- Check email first thing
- Attend pointless meetings
- Multitask constantly
- No clear priorities
- React to every notification
- Work when tired
- Skip breaks

**Action:** Invert each of these.

## Famous Examples

### Warren Buffett's Investment Approach

Buffett doesn't try to pick winners as much as he tries to avoid losers:
- Invest only in businesses he understands
- Avoid complexity
- Don't try to time the market
- Never invest in something too good to be true

### How Amazon Avoids Stagnation

Jeff Bezos asks: "How would a competitor destroy Amazon?"
Then Amazon builds that competitor themselves (AWS, third-party marketplace, etc.)

### Pre-Mortem Analysis

Before starting a project, imagine it has failed spectacularly. Ask: "What went wrong?"

This is inversion applied to planning—identify failure modes before they happen.

## The Mathematics of Avoiding Stupidity

Consider two strategies:

**Strategy A (Brilliance):**
- Occasionally brilliant (+100)
- Often mediocre (0)
- Occasionally stupid (-80)
- Expected value: Low variance, modest returns

**Strategy B (Avoiding Stupidity):**
- Never brilliant (+30)
- Consistently good (+10)
- Rarely stupid (-5)
- Expected value: Low variance, consistent positive returns

Over time, Strategy B often wins because avoiding large losses compounds better than occasional large wins.

## Inversion Questions by Domain

### Career
- "What would make me unemployable in 10 years?"
- "What would destroy my reputation?"
- "How would I ensure I never get promoted?"

### Finances
- "How would I go bankrupt?"
- "What would ensure I never build wealth?"
- "How would I lose all my money?"

### Relationships
- "What would make my partner leave?"
- "How would I lose all my friends?"
- "What would alienate my family?"

### Health
- "What would guarantee serious illness?"
- "How would I become physically incapable?"
- "What would lead to chronic disease?"

### Projects
- "What would make this project fail completely?"
- "How would I ensure missed deadlines?"
- "What would guarantee customer complaints?"

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Only Using Inversion

Inversion complements forward thinking; it doesn't replace it. Use both.

### 2. Not Being Specific Enough

"What would make me fail?" is too vague.
"What specific actions would guarantee I fail at X by Y date?" is actionable.

### 3. Not Following Through

Identifying what to avoid is useless if you don't actually avoid it.

### 4. Inverting the Wrong Thing

Make sure you're inverting the right goal. Sometimes the goal itself is wrong.

## Combining with Other Models

**Inversion + Second-Order Thinking:**
What first-order actions lead to second-order failures?

**Inversion + Pre-Mortem:**
It's 6 months from now and the project failed. What went wrong? (This is inversion applied temporally)

**Inversion + Checklists:**
Create an "anti-checklist" of things NOT to do.

## The Munger Method

Charlie Munger's approach to decision-making:
1. What could go wrong?
2. What don't I know that I need to know?
3. What are the second-order effects?
4. If I were trying to create this problem, what would I do?

The last question is pure inversion.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Flip problems around** - Ask "What would cause failure?" not just "What would cause success?"
2. **Avoid stupidity first** - Consistent avoidance of failure often beats occasional brilliance
3. **Check your current behavior** - Are you doing things on your "failure list"?
4. **Use both forward and inverted thinking** - They complement each other
5. **Be specific** - Vague inversions lead to vague insights

## The Simple Test

Before any major decision, ask:

**"What would someone who wanted this to fail do?"**

Then make sure you're not doing those things.
